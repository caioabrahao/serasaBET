# SerasaBet

Hi! This is a website built using HTML, CSS and JS, and also NodeJS to serve files and protect pages. You can switch to the folder of your choice and run this on your machine by running the following commands:

> But first, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker) installed on your machine.

```sh
# Clone this repository and switch to it
git clone https://github.com/dcdm3g/serasa-bet

# Start the NodeJS server
npm run dev
```

Yay! You now should have this website running on http://localhost:3000.
